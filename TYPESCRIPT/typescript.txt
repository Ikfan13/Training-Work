*Typescript: it is superset of javascript.
            -it is compile language.
            -it is strict type language.

*software pre-requist
1. nodejs 
    node -v // it will show node version.
    npm -v // it will show npm version.

2.Typescript 
  npm i typescript -g // it will install typescript
  tsc -v // it will display Typescript version.

*we can create typescript file by writting fileName.ts 
*How to execute typescript file 
step1: tsc fileName.ts  // it will compile ts file and generate plain js file 
step2: node fileName.js // it will execute js file 


*how to create variable in typescript 
syntax: let  variableName:datatype;

*data type in Typescript 

*write a function with three  parameter fname,mname and lname and display fullname 

*oops 
1. Class:-it is collection of data-member and member-function.
         -it is template which we can reuse.
         -to class class we use class keyword.
         -class name must start with capital letter.
   syntax: class Classname{
      data-member and member-function
   }

 -this: it represt current or current object.

2. Object: - it is an instance of class.
           -by using object we can access class data-member and member-function outside class.
           syntax:  let objName = new Classname();


 -constructor : -it is special member function of class.
                -constructor execute automaticaaly when class object is created or initialize.
                -constructor name must be only constructor in typescript.


3. Inheritance: accessing parent class property into child class.
               to perform inheritance inbetween two class we use "extends" keyword.
         syntax:  class childClassName extends parentClassName.

     -super(): -it represent parent class constructor in child class.

4. Encapsulation: warapping of data into single Unit.
5. Abstraction: hidding implementation and showing only functionality.
               -we can achieve by using interface and Abstraction method,static keyword.

    access specifier: 
    publick: we can access class property inside same class,outside class and in child class also
    protected:we can access class property inside same class, in child class but not outside class
    private: we can access class property within same class.

6. pollymosphism: ability to take more than one form.
   -method overloading : in this when we have multiple method with same in same class
   -method overrind : in this when we have multiple method with same name in different classes

*module in type: 
it can be collection of single or multiple typescript file,containig code with specific purpose.
-that data or code we can access in another file by exporting and importing.
- we use export keyword to send data from file.
- we use importing keyword to access data. 


*Interface : it is signature of class. 
            -it contain abstract method in it.
            -we create interface by using interface.
            -its child class has responsibility to implement interface.
            -to perform inheritance in between class and interface we use "implements" keyword
