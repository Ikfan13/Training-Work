        <p>Arthur found a pet dog named Copper at some point whom he grew particularly close to and occasionally took baths with. Although Arthur had difficulty controlling him, he admired the dog's spirit. Copper later passed away and Arthur kept a picture of him on his wagon. He also acquired a mare at some point named Boadicea whom he became fond of, although she passed away sometime before the gang's arrival at Colter.

        As a young adult, Arthur met a girl named Mary Gillis where the two fell deeply in love and even became engaged. He befriended her younger brother Jamie and taught him horseback-riding. However, Arthur's preference for a life of crime coupled with the prevalent disapproval of Mary's family, most strongly from her father ultimately caused their relationship to fall apart and the pair separated.</p>

        <p>Much of Dutch's early life is unknown, except the fact he was born around 1855 to Greta Van Der Linde and an unnamed father. At some point, Dutch founded his own gang after a chance encounter with Hosea Matthews, in which the two attempted to rob each other. Over time, Dutch collected many young people, including Bill Williamson, Javier Escuella, Abigail Marston, Arthur Morgan and John Marston, whom he taught how to shoot and read.</p>

        <p>John Marston was born in 1873[1] in the northern United States.[2] His father was an illiterate Scottish immigrant who was born on the boat to New York, while his mother was a prostitute, who died during John's birth. John initially lived with his father, a man who loved Scotland and always talked about it. However, he was blinded in a bar fight south of Chicago and died at some point later, when John was eight years old. The circumstances around his death are unknown, although John was told that he died in the bar fight.</p>

        <p>Sadie Adler joins the gang during the events on Chapter 1. While Arthur, Dutch, and Micah were looking for food supplies and medicine for their gang mates, they found O’Driscoll’s gang in Sadie’s home. After killing the gang members, they saved Sadie and found out that O’Driscoll’s gang raided their home and ranch and killed her husband.

            She initially travels with the gang only out of necessity, but warms up to the group and decides to join as a full member. She takes part in all of the gang’s major exploits and becomes a key member.</p>

        <img class="Uncle" src="../Assets/Images/Uncle.jpg" alt="" width="200px" height="200px">
        <p>Uncle (John O'Creagh and James McBride) is one of the oldest members of the Van der Linde gang. He is a drunkard who claims to have had several wives and traveled significantly. He also claims to have been a talented gunslinger in his younger age, and contends that he suffers from terminal lumbago.[77] During the events of the game, Uncle joins Arthur, Karen, Mary-Beth, and Tilly to Valentine, where he shows Arthur the local shop and shares with him a bottle of whiskey. Uncle later hears about a supposedly unguarded stagecoach of Leviticus Cornwall, which he robs alongside Arthur, Bill, and Charles; however, after dozens of Cornwall's men fight back, the four hide in a barn and are forced to fight to escape. He also later tells Arthur of a cattle rustling opportunity and discovers Molly O'Shea at a bar in Saint Denis. When the gang begins to fall apart, Uncle decides to leave.
            Eight years later, in 1907, Uncle reunites with John Marston in Blackwater as the latter is buying a property. Uncle tracks down Charles Smith, and the two help John build his ranch. After the house is built, Uncle is captured by the Skinner brothers and tortured, but soon rescued by John and Charles. He recovers and continues to work on the ranch.[10] Four years later, during the events of Red Dead Redemption in 1911, Uncle poorly looks after John's farm in his absence; when soldiers and agents later attack the ranch, Uncle joins John in defending it but is shot and killed.[11] 
            O'Creagh was cast in the role of Uncle, replacing Spider Madison from Red Dead Redemption. O'Creagh died during production and was replaced by McBride; O'Creagh's singing lines still appear in the game</p>

        <img class="Micah" src="../Assets/Images/Micah.jfif" alt="" width="200px" height="200px">
        <p>Micah is a name Red Dead Redemption 2 players know and hate. While plenty of in-game details reveal just how bad Micah is, it's plain for most players to see from the start. Micah was born into the outlaw's life as his father's partner in crime, as the two were already on the lam for a brutal double murder by the time Micah was 17. After committing crimes with his brother Amos, Micah floated from gang to gang until he met Dutch in 1898. After only five months in the Van der Linde gang, Micah convinced Dutch to adjust the plan for the Blackwater heist, leading to the disastrous start to Red Dead Redemption 2's story.

            Throughout the game, Micah gradually persuades Dutch to get rid of other members of the gang in order to increase his share of the Blackwater money. It's eventually revealed that Micah has also been feeding the Pinkertons information in order to save himself. Micah is responsible for Arthur's death at the end of the main story. Fortunately, players who continue on as John Marston can finally give Micah the ending he deserves.</p>

        <p>Jack's gettin' an automobile! John Marston, Jr. also known as Jack Marston, is a character in the Red Dead series who appears as the deuteragonist of Red Dead Redemption. Jack also appears as a supporting character in Undead Nightmare and appears once again as a major character in Red Dead Redemption 2.

            Jack is the son of the game's protagonist, John Marston. He, along with his mother, Abigail, and family friend, Uncle, are kidnapped by federal agents, who force John to hunt down his former brothers-in-arms. After John complete the tasks, the agents release John, Jack, Abigail, and Uncle, and the four live as a family again. However, Edgar Ross, the agent who John worked for, attacks the Marston family, killing John and Uncle. Jack begins to train with firearms, and after his mother dies, tracks down and kills Ross as revenge for his father's murder.</p>

        <p>Javier Escuella (Gabriel Sloyer) is a gunman in the Van der Linde gang. Born in Nuevo Paraíso, Mexico, Javier was forced to flee after killing a high-ranking army official. He joined Dutch's gang about four years before the events of the game, discovering a strong connection to Dutch's ideologies; as a result, he is incredibly loyal to Dutch.[40] During the events of the game in 1899, Javier joins Arthur on several occasions, including searching for John, robbing Leviticus Cornwall's train, and rescuing Sean. Javier partakes in the Saint Denis bank robbery, after which he becomes shipwrecked on Guarma with some other members of the gang. There, he is shot in the leg and captured by soldiers, but later rescued by Dutch and Arthur. Upon the group's return to America, Javier continues to assist with robberies and, when Arthur confronts Dutch, Javier sides with the latter, eventually escaping.[10] Twelve years later, during the events of Red Dead Redemption in 1911, Javier is hunted down by John Marston and captured or killed.</p>

        <img class="Lenny" src="../Assets/Images/Lenny.jpg" alt="" width="200px" height="200px">
        <p>Lenny Summers (Harron Atkins) is a young gunman in the Van der Linde gang. He is well educated, having received good schooling as a child. At the age of 15, Lenny's father was killed while walking home at night; in retaliation, Lenny stole a gun and shot his father's killers. After spending three years on the run, Lenny joined the Van der Linde gang. He is dedicated to working hard and doing his part for the gang,[48] as proven early during the events of the game when he participates in the robbery of Leviticus Cornwall's train. He forms a strong bond with Arthur, particularly when the two get drunk together in Valentine.[49] In Rhodes, Lenny tracks down a group of ex-confederates known as the Lemoyne Raiders; he and Arthur ambush their camp and kill them. Lenny later participates in the robberies of the Valentine bank and the Saint Denis trolley station, and the ambush on Angelo Bronte's mansion. During the Saint Denis bank robbery, Lenny is gunned down and killed by Pinkertons while leading the gang's escape</p>
