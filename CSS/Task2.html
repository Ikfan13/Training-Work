        <p>Arthur found a pet dog named Copper at some point whom he grew particularly close to and occasionally took baths with. Although Arthur had difficulty controlling him, he admired the dog's spirit. Copper later passed away and Arthur kept a picture of him on his wagon. He also acquired a mare at some point named Boadicea whom he became fond of, although she passed away sometime before the gang's arrival at Colter.

        As a young adult, Arthur met a girl named Mary Gillis where the two fell deeply in love and even became engaged. He befriended her younger brother Jamie and taught him horseback-riding. However, Arthur's preference for a life of crime coupled with the prevalent disapproval of Mary's family, most strongly from her father ultimately caused their relationship to fall apart and the pair separated.</p>
