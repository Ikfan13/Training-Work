*Angular:
It is application designing and development platform for creating efficient and sofisticated single page application
Angular work on component and modules

*Component:
 it id partial part of angular applicationit can be any part of application that can reuse multiple times.


*node_module:
    All Library or dependency will install on this folder

*package.json:
    it will keep entry of downloaded or install library or package.

*package-lock.json:it will hold detail information or install library

*README.md=it will work like guide manual

*gitignore:it is use to store file and folder name to ignorewhile  push data on github

note:IN Angular app is root component


How to create component:

ng generate component componentName

ng g c componentName

ng g c databinding



how to display individual component view or output
               copy component selector name from its ts file and write selector name as tag where you want 


DataBinding:access data from one file to another in same component

1.interpolation {()}- 
2.property Binding []-
3.event Binding ()-
4.Two way data Binding [()]-






*Directives:it is used to perform dom manipulation and change appearance and behaviour  of dom.

Structural Directives :it is used to change dom elemnt layout.
                       it is denoted by * symbol
                       *ngIf;it will display dom element when it get truevalue otherwise not
                       *ngfor;it is use to iterate or replace dom element
                       *ngSwitchCase;it is used to display dom element on choice
                                                              

attribute directive:it is use to change apperatnce and behaviour on choice   
                       *ngStyle:it is used to apply css propeties conditionally
                       ngClass:it is used to apply css classes conditionally.

custom directive:developer can write logic to create custom directive 
                 to create  custom directie we have command
                 ng generate directive directiveName




*Pipe:In Angular pipe is use to transform property without changing its original value;
      to use pipe we use|symbol
      there are three types of pipe:

      1.Inbuilt Pipe:
      2.Custom pipe:pipe developed by developer for use in project
      3.third party pipe:pipe developed by third party vender
 
create  component with name mypipe

ng g c component/mypipe


*Routing:Navigation of Component 
        display component output or view by writting its path in browser url
        -Routing will display component output under <router-outlet-directory>
        In angular root routing module name is app-routing-module.ts


types of routing:
 
 1>Naming Routing-
                   we write component routing path in browser url to display component output
 
 2>Default Routing-
                   display component output by default means,keep its path value blanck in routing
                   try to keep default routing in first order
 3>Redirect Routing-
                  display component output by writing diffrent path name
 
 4>Parameterize Routing-
 
 
 5>Child Routing-define one routing inside another routing 
                 for this in parent routing we have to use children property
                 in parent routing component html file we must write <router-outlet><router-outlet>
 
 
 6>Wildcard Routing-
                     display component output,when user write wrong path is browsr url.
                     in this we write "as value in routing  path 
                     wildcard routing must last routing,router define below to it never work.

Form Validation in angular:

*In angular there are two ways to perform form validation.

1.By using UTDF(User template Driven Form)-
                when we have  to perform simple and small form validation in that case we use  UTDF
                In utdf validation code will in html file.
                In this we use ngModel model directory.
2.by Using RTF(Reactive Template Form):
                when we have write complex logic to perform form validation in that case we use RTF
                In  rtf validation perform in its file
                to rtf validation first we have to import Reactive form module in root module.
                In rtf form validation we use two classes.
                1.FormGroup:it will hold call FormControl data in it as well as it tract status of form .
                2.FormControl:It will track status and validation of individual input control.



step1:import ReactiveFormsModule in root module(app.module.ts) from ReactiveFormsModule
step2:import Formgroup and FormControl class in rtf component

password:new FormControl())}"",Validators.required,Validators.pattern("^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])[A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&]{8,}$"


service:In angular service is special class with extra power
        We can share data with multiple component
        we can implement business logic in it
        we can perform external communication (fetch data from server)

        to create service 
        npx ng g service servicename

how to access service data  into any component:

    to acce3ss dsta from service to component for that in component constructor we have to create instance of service class then we can access service data into component

    create service class instance in component constructor is called dependency injection

    *How to create REST fake API:

    dummy server:json-server
    npm i -g json-server
    database:json database
    npm i -g json-server

    How to upload db.json file on json-server
    cd src/app/shared/datatbase(press enter)
    json-server --watch -p 8888 db.json(press enter)

    to make request from service to server we have to create instance of HttpClient class in service.but
    HttpClient is not a part of core angular.it is a part of HttpClientModule for this part first we have to import HttpClientModule in our root module
