*Angular:
It is application designing and development platform for creating efficient and sofisticated single page application
Angular work on component and modules

*Component:
 it id partial part of angular applicationit can be any part of application that can reuse multiple times.


*node_module:
    All Library or dependency will install on this folder

*package.json:
    it will keep entry of downloaded or install library or package.

*package-lock.json:it will hold detail information or install library

*README.md=it will work like guide manual

*gitignore:it is use to store file and folder name to ignorewhile  push data on github

note:IN Angular app is root component


How to create component:

ng generate component componentName

ng g c componentName

ng g c databinding



how to display individual component view or output
               copy component selector name from its ts file and write selector name as tag where you want 


DataBinding:access data from one file to another in same component

1.interpolation {()}- 
2.property Binding []-
3.event Binding ()-
4.Two way data Binding [()]-






*Directives:it is used to perform dom manipulation and change appearance and behaviour  of dom.

Structural Directives :it is used to change dom elemnt layout.
                       it is denoted by * symbol
                       *ngIf;it will display dom element when it get truevalue otherwise not
                       *ngfor;it is use to iterate or replace dom element
                       *ngSwitchCase;it is used to display dom element on choice

custom directive:developer can write logic to create custom directive 
                 to create  custom directie we have command
                 ng generate directive directiveName




*Pipe:In Angular pipe is use to transform property without changing its original value;
      to use pipe we use|symbol
      there are three types of pipe:

      1.Inbuilt Pipe:
      2.Custom pipe:pipe developed by developer for use in project
      3.third party pipe:pipe developed by third party vender
 
create  component with name mypipe

ng g c component/mypipe


*Routing:Navigation of Component 
        display component output or view by writting its path in browser url
        -Routing will display component output under <router-outlet-directory>
        In angular root routing module name is app-routing-module.ts


types of routing:
 
 1>Naming Routing-
                   we write component routing path in browser url to display component output
 
 2>Default Routing-
                   display component output by default means,keep its path value blanck in routing
                   try to keep default routing in first order
 3>Redirect Routing-
                  display component output by writing diffrent path name
 
 4>Parameterize Routing-
 
 
 5>Child Routing-define one routing inside another routing 
                 for this in parent routing we have to use children property
                 in parent routing component html file we must write <router-outlet><router-outlet>
 
 
 6>Wildcard Routing-
                     display component output,when user write wrong path is browsr url.
                     in this we write "as value in routing  path 
                     wildcard routing must last routing,router define below to it never work.
